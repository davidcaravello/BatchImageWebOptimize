# BatchImageWebOptimize
As quickly as possible wrote this little utilty that allows for batch quality conversion of jpg files from one directory and output to another directory.

Requires [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) portable version to be extracted into the <code>im</code> directory at the same level as the produced executable.

Resulting directory structure once compiled should be something like this:

<pre><code>
|-- im/
|   |-- convert.exe
|   |-- magic.xml
|-- BatchImageWebOptimize.exe
</code></pre>
